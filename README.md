# entrypoint

## Getting started

To make it easy setup and run the application for linux users, You just need to follow these steps:

1. Run Command `cd entrypoint`
2. Run Command `make set-up`. It will automatically install docker if not installed and pull images from docker hub and build container.
3. To up containers use command `make dirty-up`.
4. To down containers use command `make down`.
5. To rebuild containers use command `make up`.

*Note* - If you are using a linux `MakeFile` commands will work, But if you are a windows user, Please install docker by yourself and build containers.
